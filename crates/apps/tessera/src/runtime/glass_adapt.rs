//! Region-level liquid-glass backdrop adaptation — the policy half of the
//! material. prism measures each glass body's backdrop (mean luminance,
//! high-frequency energy) with a frame-slot lag and exposes the numbers;
//! this module owns everything prism deliberately does not: temporal
//! smoothing keyed by each region's stable id, quantization with hysteresis
//! (an emitted value change re-runs the glass composite, so the shipped
//! values must not dither), and the mapping from backdrop friendliness to
//! tint-strength recovery.
//!
//! The legibility budget behind the policy: white menu text (L ≈ 0.95)
//! needs a plate at L ≤ 0.18 for WCAG AA (4.5:1). With the Menu role's
//! recipe — interior frost ≈ 40% (frost_strength 5.0), pinned smoke
//! polarity, tint_strength 3.6, shader energy boost up to 2× — a bright
//! text glyph (L ≈ 0.55 over a local mean ≈ 0.2) lands at plate L ≈ 0.16
//! (≈ 4.9:1), and even a uniform white backdrop (L = 1) lands at ≈ 0.17
//! (≈ 4.6:1). The recovery curve below then hands translucency back when
//! the measured backdrop is friendly, which is where the liquid look lives.
