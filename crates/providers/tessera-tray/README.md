# tessera-tray

StatusNotifierItem (SNI) system tray service for the tessera compositor.

The crate runs as both the StatusNotifierWatcher and a StatusNotifierHost on
the session bus: a worker setup owns the `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher`
name, tracks every registered item, and mirrors them into a plain
`TraySnapshot` the render thread reads. No async runtime is involved — zbus
runs its blocking API on two `std::thread`s (signal tracking and command
dispatch) and shares state through `Arc<Mutex<_>>` + `std::sync::mpsc`.

`spawn()` returns a cloneable `TrayHandle`, or `None` when the tray is
unavailable (no session bus, or another watcher owns the name). Shell chrome
components read its snapshot for display (the HUD) or send `TrayCommand`s
for interaction (the command panel's tray section, including host-rendered
dbusmenu context menus).

## Boundaries

This crate owns D-Bus protocol machinery and icon pixmap production only. It
has no GPU, lens, or Wayland dependency; uploading pixmaps to textures and
presenting items is the consuming chrome component's job.
