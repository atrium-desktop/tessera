//! The shared application model.
//!
//! A parsed, launchable freedesktop.org desktop entry of `Type=Application`,
//! backend- and renderer-agnostic. Lives here (rather than in `tessera-desktop-entries`)
//! because the chrome in `tessera-shell` reads it to render a launcher without
//! pulling in the `.desktop` / icon-theme parsing dependency graph; `tessera-desktop-entries`
//! builds these and `tessera-launcher` consumes them.
//!
//! Locale-sensitive fields are resolved to a single value at parse time (in
//! `tessera-desktop-entries`) so the rest of the compositor never sees `Name[xx_YY]` suffixes.
