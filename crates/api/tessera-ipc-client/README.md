# tessera-ipc-client

`tessera-ipc-client` is the rich client library for the Tessera capability
broker (ADR-0125). `tessera-ipc` ships the thin transport client — schema,
codec, one blocking request/response per call — and stays free of
filesystem policy. Every out-of-process consumer of the broker performs the
same client discipline on top, and this crate owns it so each consumer
keeps only its own protocol surface:

- pairing handshake discipline: a generous handshake timeout for the
  interactive pairing prompt, then a short per-request I/O timeout;
- credential policies: a durable, atomically persisted pairing identity
  (`IdentityStore`) and launcher-injected ephemeral credentials
  (`read_credential_from_stdin`);
- per-instance state recovery: a `flock`-held recovery lock and the
  managed Interaction Domain record (`InteractionDomainSession`), with
  crash recovery proven by the authenticated principal subject;
- connection-bound observation lease retention (`ObservationLeases`) for
  one-shot-connection consumers;
- the connection policies: one-shot connections for
  least-privilege-in-time consumers, and `PersistentConnection` for
  long-lived consumers — one multiplexed connection with lazy lease
  renewal and transparent re-pairing after a transport failure. A failed
  request is never retried automatically; server-side refusals never
  poison the connection, transport failures always do.

It is a client library, not a daemon: consumers keep their own processes,
supervision, and reconnection policies. Current consumers are `tessera-mcp`
(the MCP bridge) and `tessera-atspi` (the accessibility adapter). The
compositor never links it.
