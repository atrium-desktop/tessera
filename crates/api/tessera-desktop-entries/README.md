# tessera-desktop-entries

`tessera-desktop-entries` discovers launchable desktop applications and resolves their icons
using freedesktop.org desktop-entry and icon-theme conventions.

## Responsibilities

- Scan `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS` for regular and exported-symlink
  `.desktop` files.
- Parse application entries, localized names, desktop visibility rules, and
  `Exec` fields.
- Resolve icons through scale-aware theme metadata, recursive inheritance,
  the `hicolor` theme, and unthemed pixmap fallback.
- Produce the shared `tessera_model::app::Entry` model.

## Boundaries

This crate discovers and parses applications. It does not render launcher UI
or icons, spawn processes, or manage windows. Those responsibilities belong to
`tessera-shell`, `tessera-launcher`, and `tessera-compositor` respectively.

## Runtime Effect

Discovery is synchronous and returns a snapshot of the applications visible
to the current XDG environment. Invalid, hidden, desktop-specific, or
unusable entries are excluded from the result.

## Use

```rust
let applications = tessera_apps::enumerate();

for application in applications {
    println!("{}: {}", application.id, application.name);
}
```

Use `resolve_icon` when a caller needs an icon path for a selected entry. Use
`resolve_icon_scaled` for a HiDPI-aware lookup, and use `tessera-launcher` to start
the resulting application.
