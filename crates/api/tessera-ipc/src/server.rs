//! The compositor side of the IPC.
//!
//! [`Server::start`] binds a unix socket and spawns an accept thread; each
//! connection runs two helper threads — a reader that drives the protocol and
//! a writer that is the sole owner of the write half (so responses and
//! pushed events never contend). Mutations arrive as [`Command`]s through
//! [`Handler::command`], which the compositor forwards to its main loop:
//! the Wayland server state is not `Send`, so a connection thread must not
//! touch it directly. See ADR-0027.
//!
//! The mutation journal (ADR-0033) has a separate subscriber set
//! ([`Server::broadcast_journal`]) so status bars receiving the coarse event
//! stream are not flooded with per-command entries.
