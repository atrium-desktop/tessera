//! Compositor chrome for tessera, built on lens.
//!
//! The shell is split into a **core host** and pluggable **chrome components**.
//! The core ([`Shell`]) owns the lens context, the per-frame snapshot of
//! live toplevels, and the interaction sink ([`ChromeEvents`]); it knows
//! nothing about what the chrome looks like. Each piece of chrome — the
//! launcher, the overview — is a [`Chrome`] implementation registered with
//! [`Shell::add`], and renders itself each frame from the shared snapshot
//! and input. Larger components live in their own crates on top of the same
//! contract (the dock in `tessera-dock`, Prism in `tessera-prism`, the HUD in
//! `tessera-hud`, and the command panel in `tessera-command-panel`). Adding
//! or removing a chrome surface is a component change, not a core change.
//! [`persona`] owns the lightweight personalized-profile convention; its
//! optional `persona` feature adds shared still/VRM portrait and motion
//! handling without imposing that dependency set on every shell consumer.
//!
//! Input the compositor captures is fed here as a snapshot before being routed
//! to clients; component-emitted intents are drained by the main loop into
//! server window-management actions.
