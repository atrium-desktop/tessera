//! Interactive screenshot region selector and portal target picker.
//!
//! A modal, full-screen overlay activated by the Print key. The user drags a
//! rectangle; releasing the pointer only *stages* the selection — the frozen
//! screen keeps showing it until the user explicitly confirms (Enter/Space)
//! or cancels (Escape). A new press starts a fresh drag, replacing the staged
//! selection. The confirmed region is emitted through
//! [`ChromeEvents::screenshot_region`] so the main loop can capture and save
//! it.
//!
//! The same overlay also serves the portal's interactive picks (ADR-0054),
//! opened through [`ChromeCommand::StartPick`] with a [`PickerMode`]:
//!
//! - `Region` is the Print-key interaction, but the confirmed rect goes to
//!   the waiting IPC request instead of the screenshot file path.
//! - `Pixel` draws a compact optical loupe; a click emits the picked point
//!   through [`ChromeEvents::picked_point`].
//! - `Window` highlights the window under the cursor; a click emits its id
//!   through [`ChromeEvents::picked_window`], a click on empty desktop (or
//!   Enter/Space) chooses the whole output through
//!   [`ChromeEvents::pick_output`].
//! - `Output` highlights the output under the cursor; a click (or
//!   Enter/Space) emits its connector through
//!   [`ChromeEvents::picked_output`] (version 29, ADR-0128).
//!
//! Escape always cancels a picker session through
//! [`ChromeEvents::pick_cancelled`]; the compositor closes the loop by
//! answering the IPC request.
