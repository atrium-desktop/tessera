//! The application launcher chrome: a full-screen, Launchpad-inspired library
//! of every enumerated `.desktop` entry, backed by the pure
//! [`tessera_model::launcher::Launcher`] state machine.
//!
//! The component owns presentation state only: responsive grid geometry,
//! paging, hover/click hit-testing, and the opening/closing reveal. Search,
//! running-app matching, selection, and launch outcomes stay in `tessera-model`.
//! The compositor host captures and multi-resolution-blurs the desktop when
//! [`Chrome::backdrop_blur_sigma`] is non-zero, so the overlay remains legible
//! without replacing the user's spatial context with an opaque panel.
//!
//! # Reveal
//!
//! The open/close animation is one spring in the Dock's motion family
//! (ω₀² = 900, ζ = 0.85 — the same stiffness/damping pair as the Dock's
//! magnification wave and tile-birth springs) shaped through two windows,
//! mirroring the Dock's autohide morph in reverse:
//!
//! - **Surface** — the scrim and backdrop blur travel the whole reveal on a
//!   zero-velocity [`smoothstep`], so the veil soft-lands at both ends.
//! - **Content** — the search field, cells, and pagination stay absent for
//!   the first stretch ([`CONTENT_ARRIVE_START`]), then grow in on the same
//!   curve; on close they drain before the veil thins. Icons grow from a
//!   seed area rather than cross-fading, and the whole content body lifts
//!   off the Dock's reserved edge toward the output centre — the same
//!   direction the Dock's magnified icons pop toward.
//!
//! One spring, one curve, two windows: no per-layer easing stacks.
