//! macOS-style dock: a rounded translucent bar anchored to a screen edge of
//! the output (bottom by default; the left or right edge via
//! `[dock] position`) holding a persistent strip of pinned application
//! icons. Unlike a window list, the dock is populated from launchable
//! `.desktop` entries the binary pins (plus any running window that is not
//! already pinned), so it shows real XDG icons even when nothing is running.
//!
//! Each tile is one app — pinned or not, an application's running windows
//! fold into a single tile:
//!   - Clicking a tile whose app has a running window focuses that window;
//!     clicking a tile with no running window launches the app (`out.spawn`).
//!   - Dragging a pinned tile past a neighbour's midpoint reorders the pinned
//!     strip (`out.dock_reorder`); dragging it past the section divider
//!     unpins it, and dragging a transient tile back across the divider pins
//!     it at the hovered slot. Dragging empty panel space toward another
//!     screen edge moves the dock there (`out.dock_position`).
//!   - A small dot beside a tile (beneath it on a bottom dock) marks a
//!     running app; the dot brightens for the activated window.
//!
//! Visuals are deliberately icon-first, not button-first: tiles are drawn as
//! bare raster icons (no pill / border), and hovering magnifies the tile under
//! the cursor and its neighbours along a cosine bell. Unlike a fixed-slot
//! dock, the bar *reflows*: it widens to fit the magnified widths and the
//! neighbouring tiles spread apart around the cursor — the classic macOS
//! squeeze-and-lift. Tiles are anchored to the bar's inner baseline and scale
//! toward the screen centre, so a magnified icon pops *out* of the bar. Each
//! tile's size is driven by a damped spring with a slight under-damped
//! overshoot, so the wave tracks a moving cursor and settles with a gentle
//! bounce. Brand-new tiles (a window just mapped) spring up from a seed size
//! instead of popping in.
