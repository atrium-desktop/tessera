# tessera-dock

`tessera-dock` is the macOS-style dock chrome component for the tessera compositor,
built on the `Chrome` contract from `tessera-shell` and the shared materials from
`tessera-design`.

## Responsibilities

- Draw a translucent bottom-center bar of pinned application icons.
- Fold running windows into their pinned tile by matching `app_id` against
  each entry's `Entry::match_keys`.
- Magnify the tile under the cursor and its neighbours with a damped-spring
  reflow wave, and grow new tiles in from a seed size.
- Offer the shared application context menu, including pin/unpin actions and
  the maximize/restore and always-on-top lifecycle rows.
- Emit launch, focus, and pin-toggle intents through `ChromeEvents`.

## Boundaries

The dock owns presentation and interaction state only. The composition root
(the `tessera` binary) resolves the pinned entries and owns the decoded icon
textures; the dock receives both as borrowed snapshots pushed through
`ChromeUpdate::AppCatalog`. It never mutates Wayland state, spawns
processes, or writes configuration.

## Runtime Effect

Each frame the dock reports its reserved bottom edge, backdrop-blur regions,
and whether its magnification springs still animate. Pin toggles are drained
by the main loop into the `[dock] pinned` configuration, which answers with a
refreshed application catalog.

## Use

Push the application catalog, then register one dock with the shell:

```rust
shell.set_app_catalog(catalog);
shell.add(Box::new(tessera_dock::Dock::new()));
```

`Shell::add` seeds newly registered components with the current catalog, and
`Shell::set_app_catalog` fans replacements out to every component.
