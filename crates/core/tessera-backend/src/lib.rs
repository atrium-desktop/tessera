//! Compositor backends.
//!
//! A backend owns the presentation target and the raw input stream. The
//! *nested* backend runs as a client of an existing Wayland session. The
//! *drm* backend drives atomic KMS directly, with libinput and libseat for
//! bare-TTY operation.
//!
//! Both implement [`Backend`], so the server, renderer, and shell are written
//! once against the abstraction.
