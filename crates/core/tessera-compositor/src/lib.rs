//! Hand-rolled Wayland server for tessera.

//! Drives libwayland-server directly over FFI: it creates the display and
//! socket, advertises the core globals, and owns protocol object lifecycle. The
//! shm implementation and the core `wl_*` interface tables come from
//! libwayland-server; tessera implements the request handlers.
//!
//! libwayland callbacks receive the stable boxed `State` as a raw pointer.
//! Accessing human-seat fields through `State`'s `Deref<SeatRuntime>` creates
//! the same short-lived references that direct fields previously created.
//! The callback lifetime invariant is documented on `State`.
