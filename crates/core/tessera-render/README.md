# tessera-render

`tessera-render` converts committed client buffers into flux textures and
composites the surface tree into the current output frame.

## Responsibilities

- Upload `wl_shm` pixels and import supported dma-buf buffers.
- Apply buffer scale, transform, viewport, and subsurface geometry.
- Draw mapped surfaces in compositor z-order.
- Cache textures by surface generation and release unused GPU resources.
- Create the flux device configuration required by the compositor.
- Re-export Optics' composition-DAG planner at the renderer boundary for
  explicit offscreen dependencies, ROI/damage propagation, and target
  lifetime planning.

## Boundaries

This crate does not speak Wayland, own the presentation target, choose window
placement, draw shell chrome, or decode wallpaper media. Those concerns belong
to `tessera-compositor`, `tessera-backend`, `tessera-model`, `tessera-shell`, and `tessera-wallpaper`.

## Runtime Effect

For each frame, the renderer turns the server's surface snapshots into draw
calls on a caller-owned flux canvas. It retains only the texture cache needed
to avoid re-uploading unchanged buffers.

## Use

Construct one `Renderer` for the compositor lifetime. During each frame, pass
the complete mapped shm and dma-buf frame sets plus the compositor's
authoritative surface order to `draw_surfaces_ordered`, then call `gc` with
the live surface identifiers. Do not draw backing types or subsurface classes
in separate global passes: each toplevel's complete surface tree is one
stacking unit. The executable owns this sequencing because it also draws
wallpaper and chrome around the client scene.
