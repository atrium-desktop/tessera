# tessera Documentation

tessera is a Wayland compositor for Linux, written in Rust on
[flux](https://github.com/ming2k/optics/tree/main/libs/flux) and
[lens](https://github.com/ming2k/optics/tree/main/libs/lens). Start with the
[README](../README.md) for the project pitch and the shortest run path.
