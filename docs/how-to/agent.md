# How to Connect an MCP Agent to Tessera

Use the `tessera-mcp` platform bridge to give any MCP-compatible agent scoped
desktop and Agent Interaction Domain tools. The bridge is a stateless MCP
stdio server; the agent product owns its provider and session configuration
on its side of the connection. Tessera remains the authority for every
desktop action.

## Build the Bridge

From the Tessera repository:

```bash
cargo build --locked --release -p tessera-mcp
```

The binary is `target/release/tessera-mcp`.

## Understand First-Run Pairing

There is nothing to declare in the Tessera configuration. The first time the
bridge connects — during `check`, `smoke`, or the first agent prompt — the
compositor opens a **pairing prompt**: one row per requested capability
family (observation, window control, workspaces, Interaction Domains, …),
each expanding to its per-operation detail. Operations marked † are
sensitive and ask again on first use. Untick anything you do not want to
lend, then choose **Allow**.

The approved set becomes the principal's ceiling, and the compositor issues
a credential the bridge persists under its data directory. Later starts,
upgrades, and script edits never prompt again. Observation capabilities are
approved independently from action capabilities. The sensitive groups —
closing windows, Interaction Domain capture, Interaction Domain
observation, Interaction Domain input, Interaction Domain management,
sandboxed launches — ask once more at first use, with
*Deny / Allow once / Allow session / Always allow* options; "Always" is
remembered until you revoke it.

Review or change everything later with `tessera permissions list`, revoke a
remembered grant with `tessera permissions revoke <principal> <op>`, trim
the ceiling with `set-ceiling`, rename the principal, or `forget` it
entirely to force re-pairing.

## Check the Grant

With Tessera running:

```bash
target/release/tessera-mcp check
```

The JSON output shows the compositor-granted capabilities, allowlists, and
exact connector-local tool names. Dismiss the pairing prompt by mistake and
the command fails closed; run it again to re-trigger pairing.

## Run the Visual Smoke Test

Run a live, reversible smoke test before connecting the agent:

```bash
target/release/tessera-mcp smoke
```

Watch for an agent notification and a temporary `Tessera Agent · Active` or
`Tessera Agent · Paused` label in the command panel's Agent Workspaces status
row (`Super+S`, **System** tab). The row reports Interaction Domain
authority, not whether the agent process is online. The first smoke run
after pairing prompts for the sensitive Interaction Domain operations one
by one; *Allow session* covers the rest of the session.

The command posts a start notification and verifies it by reading it back
from compositor state. It then verifies a temporary Interaction Domain
through `active → paused → active → revoked`, keeps the visual state
available for eight seconds by default, and confirms cleanup. Use
`--observe-seconds 15` when more inspection time is needed. If a managed
Interaction Domain already exists, the test preserves it instead of
changing or revoking user work. A second verified notification reports
completion after cleanup, so the visible result remains available after
the Agent indicator disappears.

Do Not Disturb may suppress the transient toast. The notification remains
visible from the HUD notification count, and the command still verifies its
presence in compositor state. A successful command prints a JSON report
with `"mode": "live"` and `"status": "passed"`.

To verify the real Agent operation feedback path, first open a disposable
window and find its id with `tessera window`, then run:

```bash
target/release/tessera-mcp smoke --input-window <window-id> --observe-seconds 10
```

This opt-in probe temporarily transfers only that window, retains it as a
read-only mirror on the physical desktop, and applies one pointer move at
its center. The user's XDG cursor does not move. Look for a semi-transparent
mask over the mirror with an arrow cursor at its center and an
`AGENT · Tessera Agent · Pointer move` label. The command obtains an observation
lease, commits the pointer move with its single-use token, waits for
the matching `ActorAction` journal entry, and returns the window to the
human Interaction Domain even if the probe fails. It does not click, type,
close, or launch anything. Use a disposable window because authority
changes briefly even though cleanup is automatic.

## Configure the MCP Client

Print a client configuration entry:

```bash
target/release/tessera-mcp print-config
```

The command prints an `[mcp.tessera]` entry using the current executable
path and a random stable connector id:

```toml
[mcp.tessera]
command = ["/absolute/path/to/tessera-mcp"]
enabled = true
read_only = false
environment = { TESSERA_MCP_INSTANCE_ID = "stable-random-connector-id" }
```

Register the bridge as a write-capable stdio MCP server in the agent
product's own configuration, keeping the instance id stable and unique
per entry. One catalog contains both observation and mutation tools, so
the entry must not be marked read-only.

## Exercise the Interaction Domain Loop

Ask the agent to list applications and launch one in its private
Interaction Domain. A safe interaction loop is:

1. `apps_list` resolves a real desktop id.
2. `interaction_domain_launch_app` creates or recovers the bridge-managed
   Interaction Domain and queues the sandboxed launch.
3. `interaction_domain_status` waits for the interaction group to appear.
4. `interaction_domain_observe` reads stable window placements and geometry
   and returns a short-lived, single-use observation token.
5. `interaction_domain_capture` observes the Interaction Domain's
   directed output pixels and returns a correlated observation token.
6. `interaction_domain_input` passes the token, target window id, and
   target-local physical actions. The compositor aborts if the observed state
   changed and returns a commit receipt on success.
7. a new observation, or a capture when necessary, verifies the
   effect.

The capture arrives as MCP image content, which the agent product forwards
to the model directly. When a client exposes only capture metadata, pass
the returned `image_path` to an image-reading tool the agent product
provides. Stop before coordinate input rather than guessing if neither
route makes pixels model-visible. See
[Capture Compatibility](../reference/tessera-mcp.md#capture-compatibility).

## Observe Human-Desktop Windows

The Interaction Domain loop above observes applications the agent owns. To
look at a window on the user's desktop instead — frontmost or background,
minimized, or on another workspace — ask the agent to:

1. `desktop_snapshot` lists live window ids and titles.
2. `window_capture` with one of those ids returns the window's real content
   as MCP image content plus a compatibility `image_path`.

`window_capture` never carries an observation token and never feeds
`interaction_domain_input`: pixels from the human desktop are observation
only. The first call prompts you for a runtime grant, and the window set the
agent may capture is bounded by its approved scope. Popups extending past
the window's own bounds are clipped from the image.

## Recover or Reset

The bridge stores the managed Interaction Domain handle under
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tessera-mcp/`. The next process recovers it only when the
stable instance id, authenticated principal, and live Interaction Domain
owner all agree; a matching cosmetic label is insufficient.

Have the agent call `interaction_domain_reset` only when you want to end
the Interaction Domain and return its controlled windows to the human
Interaction Domain. Normal graceful EOF preserves the Interaction Domain
so connector refresh is non-destructive. Set
`TESSERA_MCP_REVOKE_ON_EXIT=true` only when process exit must destroy its
Interaction Domain.

For the complete scope, environment, tool, and exit-status contract, see
the [tessera-mcp Bridge Reference](../reference/tessera-mcp.md).
